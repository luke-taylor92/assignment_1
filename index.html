            My name is Luke Taylor, I am a video engineer currently living in Melbourne, Australia with my 1 year old tabby Tommy. 
            I was born in Australia but have spent most of my career in the Middle East, Europe and Asia. I speak English and am conversational in German though I understand more than I can actually speak. <br><br>
            My career up until now has been designing, building and operating the video systems for large events such as Rio 2016 Olympics and South East Asian Games in 2017. 
            As well as Concert tours such as KISS 2017 European Tour and Drake 2019 World Tour. In my spare time, I volunteer with the SES and enjoy scuba diving.

        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <h4>
            What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
            Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). 
        </h4>
   
        <p>
            My interest in IT comes from the nature of my job, the industry is fast moving towards an IP based model. 
            My experience comes from on the job exposure, I am a media server specialist and work heavily with closed loop networks and fibre optic distribution systems. 
            There was no particular event or person that sparked my interest more the shift to using more and more common IT infrastructure in my day to day role.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Why did you choose to come to RMIT? 
        </h4>
        <p>
            I chose RMIT for IT because I was already a student at RMIT, doing engineering but decided to change majors. 
            But I chose RMIT because of it is more focused on practical application rather than pure theory.
        </p>
        <h4>
            What do you expect to learn during your studies
        </h4>
        <p>
            I expect to get a more in depth understanding of the IT industry and technology as well as develop programming skills.

            A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you. 
        </h4>
        <p>
            This job is appealing to me because it combines my experience that I have from the last 10 years in the industry with elements of IT such as advances networking, 
            DevOps and cloud-based infrastructure as well as software development.  
        </p>

        <h4>
            A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Other than the afore mentioned industry experience, the skills required are a deep understanding of networking, an understanding of software and software development and cloud computing. 
            The job is not calling for a specific qualification, although this is not uncommon as there are very few degrees that exist in the space. But given the nature of the role I believe an IT degree would be advantageous.
        </p>    

        <h4>
            A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. 
            This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can. 
        </h4>
        <p>
            In combination with what I am learning at college, taking online courses on places like udemy and obtaining certifications like CCNA will help me to get my skills more up to par for a role such as this.

        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <div>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                In the organisation I work for, we have a need for complex passwords to be sent to our technicians. 
                My project idea is to build an app to solve an issue that we see commonly of the technicians not knowing what letters are in these complex passwords. 
                Such as an uppercase i (I) or a lowercase L (l) and the difference between the number zero (0) and letter o (O). The app would be able to take in the password or one-time passcode sent to the technician and give a clear read out of each letter 
                e.g. “The first character is an Uppercase Alpha, “the second character is the number seven”.   
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
                Every day I see technicians calling into my department with issues relating to the access codes. 
                At least a few of them each day are down to the technician not reading or interpreting these codes correctly. 
                This amounts to a lot of lost productivity over all the technicians and helpdesk agents over the course of a day. 
                Having a simple tool for the technicians to be able to put the code into and spell out the code for them would save time for technicians on site and reduce the number workload onto our department. 
                There are websites that will flip the case of an input but due to the nature of our work, copying passwords into an unknown website could pose a security risk.    
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                The app will be an android app as that is the platform my organisation uses. 
                When the technician opens the app, they would be presented with a GUI that has a description of what the app does.    
                Below that there will be an input box and text that asks them to paste in the password or code they have been sent by the automated system. 
                Underneath there would be a button that says submit or something similar. 
                Once submitted a box would appear below and print out a line for every letter of the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, If the code was AbCd1234 the output would be:<br>
                The first Character is an Uppercase ALPHA (A)<br>
                The second Character is a Lowercase BRAVO (b)<br>
                The third Character is an Uppercase CHARLIE (C)<br>
                The fourth Character is a Lowercase DELTA (d)<br>
                The fifth Character is the Number ONE (1)<br>
                The sixth character is the Number TWO (2)<br>
                The seventh Character is the Number THREE (3)<br>
                The eighth Character is the Number FOUR (4)<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the technician has this, they will be able to input the passcode correctly into whatever piece of equipment they are working with. 
                The app would be built with capability for up to 24 characters as that leaves some room for longer codes to be entered if needed. 
                The app could also be built with non-alphanumeric characters such as the ampersand (&) or backslash (\).
            </p>
            <p>
                When the passcode is submitted into the app, the program would take the character position and store it in a variable called &#34;char_pos&#34;. 
                Then take the character in that position and store it in a variable named &#34;char&#34; The app will then test character against a database of known characters and store the result in a variable called &#34;char_def&#34;.<br>
                Such as:<br>
                &#34;a&#34; = &#34;a Lowercase ALPHA&#34;<br>
                &#34;A&#34; = &#34;an Uppercase ALPHA&#34;<br>
                &#34;1&#34; =  &#34;the Number ONE&#34;<br>
                &#34;&&#34; =  &#34;an AMPERSAND&#34;<br>
                etc

            </p>
            <p>
                The program would then take the position and query for the word associated with it and store it as a variable &#34;char_pos_name&#34;.<br>
                This list would be:<br>
                &#34;1&#34; = &#34;first&#34;<br>
                &#34;2&#34; = &#34;second&#34;<br>
                &#34;3&#34; = &#34;third&#34;<br>
                etc
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the program has all the data it would print the data out in a new line in the box below the submit button.<br>
                The line will be printed in the following format:<br>
                &#34;The &#34; char_pos_name &#34;Character is &#34; char_def &#34; (&#34; char &#34;)&#34;
            </p>
            <p>
                Once this has printed the program will repeat while the variable char_pos is less than or equal to the length of the password.<br>  
                I would also implement a clear button that would clear the input field as well as the output and the variables. 
                I would also make it so when the app is closed the data is cleared too. This is for security reasons as to not save any password data in the app. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
            <p>
                The android app should be fairly simple to develop. I can build the app on a python backend and then build out a GUI on a framework like Kivy. 
                I would not require any other hardware other than a computer and an android phone for testing. The software I would need is an IDE like Visual Studio Code, 
                The Python and Kivy packages, and a Linux VM with Buildozer to creating the APK.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Skills Required</h4>
            <p>
                The skills required will be a knowledge of Python, Kivy and Buildozer. As well as understanding of how Android apps work. 
                I have some python skills and basic Kivy skills. I would be able to use tutorials and documentation online to learn how to fully build out the GUI in Kivy and how to create and run the Android app in Buildozer.   
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>
                I think if the project was successfully created and rolled out to the technicians in my organisation, we would be able reduce the number of calls in and time wasted by the technicians. 
                This will overall save money as the number of man hours wasted will be reduced. 
                It will also give the customers a more seamless experience as they will not be waiting for a technician to call into the helpdesk to get passwords reset or clarified. 
                Finally, the technicians will be less annoyed as it will help reduce wait times to call in as there will be less calls coming in.
